# Basket Analysis Project

This project performs a **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** using transaction data to uncover relationships between products purchased together. It provides insights into customer buying patterns, helping businesses optimize cross-selling strategies and product placement.

## Overview

- **Total Transactions:** 7,835  
- **Unique Products:** 170  
- **Key Objective:** Identify product combinations frequently purchased together to optimize store layout, promotions, and product bundling.

### Key Components

1. **Basket Analysis Network**  
   - Visualizes relationships between products.
   - Nodes represent products; edges show associations between them.
   - Node size indicates product frequency in transactions.
   - Example:
     - *Yogurt* (14.4%) and *Root Vegetables* (14.1%) show strong associations.
     - *Whipped/Sour Cream* (13.7%) also demonstrates high connectivity with other products.

2. **Basket Analysis Map**  
   - Scatter plot showing product associations.
   - X-axis: **Lift** - measures how much more often two products are bought together compared to being bought independently.
   - Y-axis: **Support** - the frequency of transactions containing the product pair.

3. **Basket Analysis Details**  
   - Tabular summary of product pairs and their metrics:
     - **Support**: Frequency of the pair being bought together.
     - **Confidence**: Likelihood of a product being purchased given another product is bought.
     - **Lift**: Strength of the association between products.
